# Output contracts

Contracts describe results, never the agent's private reasoning or search sequence.
Read only the relevant schema under `../schemas/`. Review and adjudication require JSON; exploration,
research, and implementation may use concise prose when parsing offers little value.
The optional Claude background bridge requires an implementation JSON file for
machine collection, even when the task is design direction without code changes.
Normal conversation and design explanations may remain prose. Its dispatch target
identifies the initial source; the bridge reports the final source target separately
for subsequent native review. See [Claude design delegation](claude-design.md).
Empty lists are valid where there is nothing to report. Do not manufacture findings.

Common fields: `schema_version: 1`, `kind`, `task_id`, `target_id`, `status`
(`complete|blocked|failed`), and a short `summary`.

| Kind | Additional fields |
| --- | --- |
| exploration | `locations`, `findings`, `evidence`, `unresolved` |
| research | `conclusions`, `sources` (URL, applicable version, checked date, support), `uncertainties` |
| implementation | `changed_files`, `checks` (command, outcome, evidence), `remaining` |
| review | `verdict`, `violations`, `bugs`, `suggestions`, `checked_scope`, `evidence`, `unresolved` |
| adjudication | `verdict`, `review_sha256`, `decisions`, `checked_scope`, `evidence`, `unresolved` |

Review findings contain `location`, `claim`, `evidence`. Suggestions are short strings.
`verdict` is `pass|changes_required|inconclusive`. Missing evidence/coverage or unresolved
questions require inconclusive. A valid changes_required/inconclusive reply is useful
data, not acceptance. The implementer returns what actually ran, including failures.
Research sources must support the attached claim; a URL's existence is not proof.

Adjudication decisions have `ref`, `action`, `basis`, `evidence`, and `rationale`.
`ref` addresses the original review's array and zero-based index, e.g. `bugs/0`.
Every item of `violations`, `bugs`, `suggestions`, and `unresolved` must be covered
exactly once; no invented or duplicate references. `basis` states the requirement's
authority or why it is not warranted. `action` is `fix|investigate|reject|human_decision`.
Bind `review_sha256` to `sha256:` followed by the hex SHA-256 of the exact review file
bytes (compute with Python hashlib or a system SHA-256 tool; do not guess the hash).
Preserve original review files; edited findings require a new adjudication.

The adjudication verdict is `accept|changes_required|inconclusive`. `accept` requires
complete status, scope/evidence, no unresolved matters, and only rejected findings
(or no findings). Source review must be complete with scope/evidence, not inconclusive,
and have no unresolved matters. `changes_required` requires adopted fixes and no pending
investigations/human decisions. Pending decisions or evidence make it `inconclusive`.
A complete review's `changes_required` may lead to adjudication `accept` if every claim
is rejected on evidence. Validators check consistency, not the truth of this judgment.

Native spawn has no assumed schema-enforcement capability. Put the relevant shape in
the prompt, state that enforcement is unavailable when it is, and validate the return:

```sh
uv run <plugin>/scripts/astraeus.py validate-result .astraeus/result.json \
  --kind review --task-id task-1 --target-id <current-target> --accept

uv run <plugin>/scripts/astraeus.py validate-result .astraeus/adjudication.json \
  --kind adjudication --task-id task-1 --target-id <current-target> \
  --review-result .astraeus/result.json --accept
```

`uv run` installs only the declared JSON Schema validator dependency, not any model
runtime. Alternatively install jsonschema in your Python environment and use python3.
`--review-result` is required for adjudication, even without `--accept`.
`--accept` supports review and adjudication. A review must be a complete `pass` with
scope/evidence and no blocking or unresolved items; optional suggestions are allowed.
Root may accept that target without adjudication after checking the evidence and current
target. A complete `changes_required` review needs adjudication; an incomplete or
`inconclusive` review needs evidence or the next review round. Strict review acceptance
requires the reviewer host receipt via `--receipt`. Review v1 files remain valid inputs.
For other roles omit `--accept`;
inspect status and evidence before integration. No `--accept` means format/semantic
validation only (exit 0 does NOT mean acceptance).

The host receipt is separate from the child's contract. A child must not invent
runtime confirmation. Strict adjudication requires `--assurance strict --receipt`
for the adjudicator and `--review-receipt` for the reviewer, each with JSON shaped as:

```json
{"requested":{"model":"gpt-6-astra","effort":"high"},
 "observed":{"model":"gpt-6-astra","effort":"high","sandbox":"read-only"},
 "source":"host metadata: actual thread/tool response reference"}
```

The checker verifies consistency of supplied data; it cannot authenticate the receipt.
Root must obtain it from the host, never fabricate it or accept child self-report.
Do not collect extra telemetry merely to fill a receipt under reported assurance.
Root also verifies the agents are distinct and
the target and original review are still current. No receipt proves those by itself.
